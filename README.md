GSIS EduHealth System - Read Me

Welcome to the GSIS Comprehensive Insurance and Health Empowerment System!

This document provides additional instructions and important information to help you navigate and use the system effectively.

Purpose
The GSIS Comprehensive Insurance and Health Empowerment System is a website that lets people who work for the government education sector:
Make medical appointment with hospitals and doctors that are accredited by GSIS, and;
Check to see what kind of insurance they can get as government workers.
This method helps reach SDG 3 (Good Health and Well-Being) by making healthcare and insurance services easier to get, more efficient, and better handled.

How to Use
To book an appointment:
Access the website — No login is required.
Go to the “Coverage” section in the header, then choose either “Accredited Hospitals” or “Accredited Doctors” to check the list of GSIS-accredited facilities and practitioners in your area.
Once you’ve found a hospital or doctor near you, proceed directly to the “Appointment” page.
Fill out the appointment form with accurate information, including your BP Number (used to verify that you are part of the government education sector).
Submit the form.
Wait for the result — an approval or rejection notice will be sent to the Gmail address you provided in the form.

Admin Role
Admins review all appointment requests submitted through the system.
Admins approve or reject requests based on the user's eligibility (verified via BP Number) and the availability of the selected doctor or hospital.
Admins can add, edit, or remove accredited doctors and hospitals to maintain an up-to-date directory of GSIS-accredited healthcare providers.

Additional Notes
Ensure your email address is correct to receive notifications.
Your BP Number is used to verify your eligibility as a government education sector personnel.
Only one appointment request at a time is allowed. Submitting multiple entries for the same schedule may result in disapproval.

Thank you for using GSIS EduHealth!
